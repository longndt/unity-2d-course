## 🔍 What to Look For

### 1. Correctness

#### **Does the Code Work?**
- ✅ **Compiles without errors**
- ✅ **No console warnings** (or justified warnings)
- ✅ **Logic is correct**
- ✅ **Edge cases handled**

#### **Example Review Comment**
```csharp
// ❌ Problem: No null check
void OnTriggerEnter2D(Collider2D other)
{
    other.GetComponent<PlayerController>().TakeDamage(10);
}

// ✅ Review Comment:
// "What if other doesn't have PlayerController component? 
//  Add null check to prevent NullReferenceException"
```

### 2. Code Quality

#### **Is the Code Clean?**
- ✅ **Readable and understandable**
- ✅ **Follows naming conventions**
- ✅ **Properly commented**
- ✅ **No code duplication**

#### **Example Review Comment**
```csharp
// ❌ Problem: Magic numbers
if (health < 0)
{
    health = 0;
}

// ✅ Review Comment:
// "Consider using a constant: private const float MIN_HEALTH = 0f;"
```

### 3. Performance

#### **Is it Efficient?**
- ✅ **No unnecessary operations in Update()**
- ✅ **Proper object pooling** (if applicable)
- ✅ **Efficient algorithms**
- ✅ **No memory leaks**

#### **Example Review Comment**
```csharp
// ❌ Problem: Finding object every frame
void Update()
{
    GameObject player = GameObject.Find("Player");
    // ...
}

// ✅ Review Comment:
// "GameObject.Find() is expensive. Cache the reference in Start() or Awake()"
```

### 4. Unity Best Practices

#### **Unity-Specific Issues**
- ✅ **Uses FixedUpdate() for physics**
- ✅ **Uses Update() for input**
- ✅ **Uses LateUpdate() for camera**
- ✅ **Proper component architecture**
- ✅ **Prefabs used correctly**

#### **Example Review Comment**
```csharp
// ❌ Problem: Physics in Update()
void Update()
{
    rigidbody2D.velocity = new Vector2(speed, 0);
}

// ✅ Review Comment:
// "Physics movement should be in FixedUpdate() for consistent behavior"
```

### 5. Security & Safety

#### **Is it Safe?**
- ✅ **No hardcoded secrets**
- ✅ **Input validation**
- ✅ **Null checks where needed**
- ✅ **Bounds checking**

#### **Example Review Comment**
```csharp
// ❌ Problem: No bounds check
public void SetHealth(float newHealth)
{
    health = newHealth;
}

// ✅ Review Comment:
// "Add bounds checking: health = Mathf.Clamp(newHealth, 0, maxHealth);"
```

## 💬 Giving Feedback

### Feedback Principles

#### **Be Constructive**
```
❌ Bad: "This code is terrible"
✅ Good: "This could be improved by caching the reference"

❌ Bad: "You're doing it wrong"
✅ Good: "Consider using FixedUpdate() for physics movement"
```

#### **Be Specific**
```
❌ Bad: "Fix the bug"
✅ Good: "Line 42: Add null check before calling TakeDamage()"

❌ Bad: "This is confusing"
✅ Good: "This method name doesn't clearly indicate what it does. 
          Consider renaming to CalculateJumpVelocity()"
```

#### **Be Kind**
```
❌ Bad: "Why did you do this? It's obviously wrong"
✅ Good: "I see what you're trying to do. Have you considered 
          this alternative approach?"
```

#### **Explain Why**
```
❌ Bad: "Use FixedUpdate()"
✅ Good: "Use FixedUpdate() instead of Update() because physics 
          calculations need to run at fixed intervals for 
          consistent behavior across different frame rates"
```

### Types of Comments

#### **1. Must Fix (Blocking)**
```markdown
**Must Fix**: This will cause a crash. Add null check before accessing component.
```
- **Blocks merge** until fixed
- **Critical issues** only

#### **2. Should Fix (Important)**
```markdown
**Should Fix**: Consider caching this reference to avoid repeated GetComponent() calls.
```
- **Should be addressed** but not blocking
- **Code quality improvements**

#### **3. Nice to Have (Optional)**
```markdown
**Suggestion**: This could be more readable with a helper method.
```
- **Optional improvements**
- **Polish and refinement**

#### **4. Questions**
```markdown
**Question**: Why is this value hardcoded? Should it be configurable?
```
- **Seeking clarification**
- **Understanding decisions**

### Review Comment Examples

#### **Good Review Comment**
```csharp
// Code being reviewed
void Update()
{
    if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Space))
    {
        Jump();
    }
}

// Review Comment:
"✅ Good use of GetKeyDown() for jump input. 
 Consider using the new Input System for better flexibility 
 (though this works fine for now)."
```

#### **Another Good Review Comment**
```csharp
// Code being reviewed
private float health = 100f;

// Review Comment:
"💡 Suggestion: Consider making this a [SerializeField] 
 so it can be adjusted in the Inspector without code changes."
```

### How to Handle Reviews

#### **1. Don't Take it Personally**
- **Code review is about code**, not you
- **Everyone gets feedback**
- **It's a learning opportunity**

#### **2. Read All Comments Carefully**
- **Understand the concern**
- **Ask questions if unclear**
- **Don't dismiss feedback**

#### **3. Respond to Comments**
```markdown
// On GitHub/GitLab, respond to each comment:

"Good catch! I've added the null check."

"Thanks for the suggestion. I've refactored this to use 
 a helper method for better readability."

"I see your point, but I chose this approach because [reason]. 
 What do you think?"
```

#### **4. Make Changes**
- **Address all "Must Fix" comments**
- **Consider "Should Fix" suggestions**
- **Explain if you disagree** (respectfully)

#### **5. Request Re-review**
- **After making changes**, request another review
- **Don't merge** until approved

### Example Response
```markdown
Thanks for the review! I've addressed your comments:

✅ Added null check (line 42)
✅ Cached the reference in Awake()
✅ Moved physics to FixedUpdate()

I kept the magic number for now because it's only used once, 
but I'm open to extracting it if you think it's needed.

Ready for re-review!
```

## 🎮 Unity-Specific Considerations

### Common Unity Review Points

#### **1. MonoBehaviour Lifecycle**
```csharp
// ✅ Good: Proper lifecycle usage
void Awake()
{
    // Component references
    rb = GetComponent<Rigidbody2D>();
}

void Start()
{
    // Dependencies on other objects
    player = FindObjectOfType<PlayerController>();
}

void Update()
{
    // Input and game logic
}

void FixedUpdate()
{
    // Physics
}
```

#### **2. Component Access**
```csharp
// ❌ Bad: Finding every frame
void Update()
{
    GameObject.Find("Player").transform.position = target;
}

// ✅ Good: Cache reference
private Transform playerTransform;

void Start()
{
    playerTransform = GameObject.Find("Player").transform;
}

void Update()
{
    playerTransform.position = target;
}
```

#### **3. Prefab Usage**
```csharp
// ✅ Good: Using prefabs
public GameObject enemyPrefab;

void SpawnEnemy()
{
    Instantiate(enemyPrefab, spawnPoint, Quaternion.identity);
}
```

#### **4. Scene Management**
```csharp
// ✅ Good: Proper scene loading
using UnityEngine.SceneManagement;

public void LoadNextLevel()
{
    SceneManager.LoadScene(nextSceneName);
}
```

### Unity Performance Review

#### **Check for Performance Issues**
- ❌ **GetComponent() in Update()** → Cache in Awake/Start
- ❌ **GameObject.Find() in Update()** → Cache reference
- ❌ **String comparisons in Update()** → Use tags or layers
- ❌ **Instantiate/Destroy frequently** → Use object pooling
- ❌ **Expensive calculations every frame** → Cache results

## ⚠️ Common Issues

### Issue 1: Missing Null Checks
```csharp
// ❌ Problem
void OnTriggerEnter2D(Collider2D other)
{
    other.GetComponent<PlayerController>().TakeDamage(10);
}

// ✅ Fix
void OnTriggerEnter2D(Collider2D other)
{
    PlayerController player = other.GetComponent<PlayerController>();
    if (player != null)
    {
        player.TakeDamage(10);
    }
}
```

### Issue 2: Wrong Update Method
```csharp
// ❌ Problem: Physics in Update()
void Update()
{
    rigidbody2D.velocity = new Vector2(speed, 0);
}

// ✅ Fix: Physics in FixedUpdate()
void FixedUpdate()
{
    rigidbody2D.velocity = new Vector2(speed, 0);
}
```

### Issue 3: Magic Numbers
```csharp
// ❌ Problem
if (health < 0)
{
    health = 0;
}

// ✅ Fix
private const float MIN_HEALTH = 0f;
private const float MAX_HEALTH = 100f;

if (health < MIN_HEALTH)
{
    health = MIN_HEALTH;
}
```

### Issue 4: Code Duplication
```csharp
// ❌ Problem: Duplicated code
void Attack1()
{
    animator.SetTrigger("Attack");
    damage = 10;
    // ... attack logic
}

void Attack2()
{
    animator.SetTrigger("Attack");
    damage = 15;
    // ... same attack logic
}

// ✅ Fix: Extract common logic
void PerformAttack(int attackDamage, string triggerName)
{
    animator.SetTrigger(triggerName);
    damage = attackDamage;
    // ... attack logic
}
```

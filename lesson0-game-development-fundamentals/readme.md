## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Create New 2D Project
1. Open Unity Hub → New Project → **2D (URP)** template
2. Project name: `Lesson0-GameFundamentals`
3. Create project and wait for Unity to load

### Step 2: Explore the Example
1. Open the `example/` folder in this lesson
2. Import the provided scripts into your project
3. Create a new scene: `File → New Scene → 2D`
4. Add the example scripts to GameObjects and test them

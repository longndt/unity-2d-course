# Lesson 4: Input & Player Controller

## Overview

**Difficulty**: Intermediate
**Prerequisites**: Lesson 3 completed, Basic C# programming (basic Input System from Lesson 1)

Master the Input System with advanced patterns, professional camera systems, and responsive player controls. This lesson builds on the basic input introduced in Lesson 1, covering Input Actions, PlayerInput, rebinding, and advanced camera setups including Cinemachine.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Master Input System: Input Actions, Action Maps, bindings, and `PlayerInput` component
- Compare event-based vs polling input patterns and when to use each
- Implement advanced input handling: move/jump/dash with input buffering and rebinding
- Build professional camera systems: Cinemachine integration, camera bounds, smoothing, and follow patterns
- Respect UI focus and disable gameplay input when menus are open
- Create reusable input handling patterns for different game types

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Create a scene `Lesson4-Input`
2. Create an `Input Actions` asset and generate C# class
3. Add scripts from `example/`: `PlayerInputController.cs`, `Player2DController.cs`, `AutoInputEvents.cs`, `InputSystemComparison.cs`
4. Wire `PlayerInput` to your character; press Play and test with keyboard/gamepad

## 📚 Learning Path

- Reference → `reference/` (Input System setup)
- Example → `example/` (validate bindings and actions)
- Theory → `theory/theory4.md`
- Lab → `lab/lab4-instructions.md`
- Quiz → [`quiz/quiz4.html`](quiz/quiz4.html) (test your understanding)

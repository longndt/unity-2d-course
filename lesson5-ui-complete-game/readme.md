# Lesson 5: UI & Complete Game

## Overview

**Difficulty**: Intermediate → Advanced
**Prerequisites**: Lesson 4 completed, Basic C# programming

Build a vertical slice including menus, HUD, pause/state management, simple save/load, and prepare builds for target platforms.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Create complete UI systems: menus (main/pause/results) and HUD (health bars, score, text)
- Understand UI components: Canvas, RectTransform, Layout Groups, Event System
- Manage gameplay states and pause/resume flow with proper time scale control
- Wire basic save/load systems (PlayerPrefs or JSON serialization)
- Prepare platform-specific build profiles and test builds
- Profile runtime performance and iterate on optimization

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Create scenes: `MainMenu`, `Game`, `Results`
2. Add scripts from `example/`: `MenuManager.cs`, `MainMenuPanel.cs`, `HUDManager.cs`, `UIPanel.cs`, `UIButton.cs`, `UISlider.cs`, `UIText.cs`, `SpecializedButtons.cs`, `HealthBar.cs`
3. Implement pause (time scale), scene transitions, and basic save/load
4. Build for Windows/macOS; test runtime behavior

## 📚 Learning Path

- Reference → `reference/` (UI components, state machine checklist)
- Example → `example/` (run full loop and verify UI states)
- Theory → `theory/theory5.md`
- Lab → `lab/lab5-instructions.md`
- Quiz → [`quiz/quiz5.html`](quiz/quiz5.html) (test your understanding)

## 👥 Group Project Option

Lesson 5 is perfect for **group collaboration**! Working in teams (2-5 members) allows you to:
- Build a more complete game
- Learn version control and collaboration
- Practice code review and team communication
- Experience professional game development workflows

**📖 Group Project Guide**: See `group-project-guidelines.md` for:
- Team formation and role assignment
- Project planning and task breakdown
- Git workflow and version control
- Conflict resolution strategies
- Quality assurance practices

**💡 Recommended**: Complete individual lab first, then try group project for deeper learning experience.
